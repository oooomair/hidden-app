      "story": "I was walking down the street from my house to get some milk I reached the supermarket where half the building was under construction as it was being turned into a half restaurant and half supermarket due to which there was a lot of noise as i went through the door I could hear only people shouting on top of the construction noise I thought they were just doing there work so I grabbed the milk and walked towards the cashier who was talking to their partner but as I got closer I saw that they were actually arguing aggressively on something and the guy standing there was the manager when I reached the cashier he was on about how he wants to quit and I was standing there not knowing what was happening I gave the cashier my milk and to my disbelief, I kid you not he straight up chucked the milk down the aisle and walked away taking off his clothes the manager looked at me and told me I can get new milk for free so I took two milk cartons and went home",
